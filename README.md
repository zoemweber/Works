### Works

*This is a repository composed of some of the coding work I have done. Enjoy*



# Research

**BHL** - *A directory including some work that I did on Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton. This was apart of my research using FLASH, where all the simulations were run.*

**Velocity.ipynb** - *These are some of the main plots I created for my thesis on accreting white dwarfs. Data was taken from the simulations run in MESA.*




# Class Work

**2DFluidFlow.ipynb** - *A fluid flow simulation, the video **2D.mp4** was created from*

**Earthquakes.ipynb** - *Code pertaing to the collection, analysis and represntation of data on earthquakes.*

**StarEvol.ipynb** - *Exploration of stellar evolution. More data collection and analysis with modeling.*

**GravDynam.ipynb** - *Numerical computation and physical modeling, simulating gravitational dynamics with ordinary differential equations.*




# Lab Work

*These lack commentary. As the code was not originally meant to be seen, it's a bit messy. These sections of code, however, 
contain many plots that are a good example of my ability to calculate/plot errors and lines of best fit.*
